# End-Of-Field-challenge
I had to recreate two interfaces: a simple and a more complex one.
I also created a main interface to navigate to the two interfaces.

## Restrictions
I wasn't allowed to use a CSS Framework for this challenge.
But ... I used Bootstrap for my main interface and not to create the required two interfaces.
The main interface wasn't a part of the challenge, so technically I didn't break any rules.
I just wanted to show all my current skills :see_no_evil:

## Tools
- Visual Studio Code (HTML,CSS)
- Markdown
- ColorZill chrome extension
- PixelZoomer chrome extension
- Google Fonts
- Bootstrap
- Flaticon
- Measure-it

## Deployment
Github pages

## Results
- main interface: https://valerievr.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/
- simple interface: https://valerievr.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/simple.html
- complex interface: https://valerievr.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/complex.html
